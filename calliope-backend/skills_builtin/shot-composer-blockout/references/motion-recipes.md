# Motion Recipes

Timing and choreography judgment for keyframed blockout motion, adapted from
classic animation-timing practice (anime.js/GSAP timeline choreography and the
12-principles shorthand) translated into `shot_*` tool calls. Times are
seconds; the timeline max is 60.

## Core pattern: stage → commit

Every recipe is the same loop:

1. `set_transform` (and/or `set_joint`) — stage the pose
2. `add_keyframe(object_id, time)` — pin it
3. change only `time` between commits — the interpolation engine does the rest

Spacing between keyframes controls speed; what you stage controls meaning.

## Easing without an easing control

Interpolation between two keyframes is smoothstep (ease-in-out). Use that as
the default motion feel. To fake other easings with plain keyframes:

- **Ease-out (decelerate to rest)** — sample the curve: for a 3s move to
  x=6, commit at t=0 (x=0), t=0.6 (x≈3.4), t=1.5 (x≈5.4), t=3 (x=6). Two
  early keyframes close together, then a long glide.
- **Constant speed (linear)** — 3+ evenly spaced keyframes flatten the
  smoothstep: t=0, 1, 2, 3 at equal position steps.
- **Anticipation (cartoon read)** — before the main move, commit a small pose
  in the OPPOSITE direction: crouch at t=1 (y −0.15), launch at t=1.4,
  land at t=2.6. The beat before the action sells the action.

## Canonical recipes

**Walk-across (A → B):** spawn key at t=0 (auto); `set_transform` B →
`add_keyframe` at t=d. Add a mid key at t=d/2 with a slight y bounce
(±0.05) if the character should feel alive. Legs won't step — this is
blockout framing, not final animation.

**Jump:** crouch (y −0.2, knees bent via `set_joint`) at t=0 → apex
(y +1, legs extended) at t=0.5 → ground (y 0, knees bent landing) at t=1 →
settle (standing posture) at t=1.3. The crouch IS the anticipation.

**Head turn / look:** keep position fixed; `set_joint` head y ±60°, key at
t=0.2, then to the new heading at t=0.8. Small and slow beats big and fast
for reads.

**Door / prop interaction:** character walks to the prop (walk-across),
pause key 0.3s, arm extends (`set_joint` l_arm) + key, prop transform changes
(`update_keyframe` or its own track) on the same beat.

**Two objects crossing:** keyframe object A on its track first (all its
times), then object B. Overlap the mid times so the crossing happens near
the same beat — the eye reads simultaneous motion as intentional.

## Camera vs objects

Object tracks are viewport preview for framing; the **camera track is what
export renders**. To feature object motion in an exported clip, keep motion
within the framed area and let the camera track hold (or slowly push) while
the action plays. Keys for the camera come from the timeline UI (◉), not
from `shot_*` tools.

## Timing vocabulary (rule of thumb)

| Read | Key spacing |
|---|---|
| Snap / impact | ≤ 0.2s between keys |
| Normal action | 0.5–1.5s |
| Drift / ambience | 3s+ |
| Hold | duplicate the same pose at a later time (never delete the last key) |

## Failure handling

- Object jumps back to an old position mid-playback: a stale keyframe is
  being sampled — `get_scene`, find it, `update_keyframe` or
  `move_keyframe_time` (don't re-stage over it with `set_transform`).
- `add_keyframe` refused at t>60: the timeline caps at 60s; widen the
  choreography, don't fight the cap.
- Character vanishes after posing: a malformed posture array NaNs
  mannequin-js silently — `reset_pose` restores it; never hand-build
  posture data.

## Video → blockout (attached clip recreation)

An attached video arrives as ~8 evenly-spaced frames, each stamped with its
time in the clip (`frame at 1.25s`). The frames ARE the motion storyboard —
recreate it, don't improvise a new choreography.

**Workflow:**

1. **Read the frames in order** — identify subjects (characters vs moving
   props), roughly where each starts/ends, and the big pose changes between
   consecutive frames.
2. **Build the cast** — `add_object` for each subject, positioned to match
   the FIRST frame. Name them after their role in the clip (e.g.
   "Fighter A").
3. **Key the opening pose** — stage pose/transform to match frame 1, then
   `add_keyframe(subject, 0)`.
4. **Walk the frames** — for each later frame at time t: stage the pose
   change you see (`set_transform` for travel, `set_joint` for limb work),
   then `add_keyframe(subject, t)` using the FRAME's timestamp, not a
   rounded number. Key EVERY subject on the SAME timestamps so their tracks
   stay synchronized with each other and with the video clock.
5. **Finish** — `set_playback(duration=<clip length>)`, then tell the user
   what you captured and what you approximated.

**Fidelity rules:**

- Fast motion (a punch, a spin) between two frames: 2–3 keys on the travel
  path beat one heroic guess — read the timing vocabulary table above.
- Camera moves in the clip are perspective changes, not subject motion —
  block the SUBJECTS; do not move the camera for them (the camera track is
  the user's, keyed from the timeline UI).
- 8 frames can't hold every beat. Prioritize the pose changes that define
  the action (start, contact, recoil, end); say so in your summary.
- If the frames are ambiguous (motion blur, off-screen action), take the
  simple read and note it — never fabricate precise choreography you can't
  see.
