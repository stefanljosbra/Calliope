"""System prompt composition — a section registry, assembled per step.

Ported from the deepseek-harness shape: the system prompt is a list of
registered sections (key, order, render) sorted by order and joined.
One broken section must never kill the prompt.

The tool-discipline section is deliberately LEAN. This is a local harness
for a local user: the rules teach the ReAct cycle (look → act → observe →
decide → finish) and get out of the way. The user's message is the plan;
permissions flow from it; guards exist to catch mistakes, not to run the
show. What killed canvas/70 was an agent that got a guard denial and then
ground in circles for ten minutes — the rules below make escalation and
finishing first-class moves instead.
